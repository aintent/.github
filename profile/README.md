# ✨ Aintent Protocol — Intention is All You Need

Welcome to **Aintent**, where we’re building the infrastructure for **intention-driven automation**. Powered by AI, decentralized consensus, and cryptographic proof, Aintent is the missing layer between *what you mean* and *what gets done* — with full transparency, verifiability, and autonomy.

## 🧠 What is Aintent?

Aintent is a protocol that transforms natural language into **provably correct, on-chain workflows**. Think of it as a new internet primitive where your intention becomes a verifiable action plan — executed by agents, validated by zk-proofs, and logged immutably.

At the heart of it all:  
> “**Intention is All You Need.**”

## 🛠️ Core Components

- **Deep Intent Architecture (DIA)** — Captures and decomposes human intent into goal graphs.
- **DIML** — A markup language for defining workflows with context, constraints, and verifiability.
- **AVM (Agent Virtual Machine)** — Executes tasks in a decentralized, zk-verified environment.
- **PoM (Proof of Mutations)** — A novel consensus that verifies *what changed*, not *who paid*.

## 🔍 Why Aintent?

- ✅ **Verifiability** — Every step in a workflow is backed by zk-SNARKs.
- 🤖 **Autonomous Agents** — LLMs + solvers that fulfill intents trustlessly.
- 💬 **Natural Language Interface** — Say it simply, and the system handles the rest.
- 🌍 **Decentralized by Design** — No black boxes. No lock-in. No middlemen.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Autonomous agents that can *prove* what they did  
- DAO workflows that run on intent, not scripts  
- AI assistants with full audit trails  
- Dynamic, user-owned APIs
